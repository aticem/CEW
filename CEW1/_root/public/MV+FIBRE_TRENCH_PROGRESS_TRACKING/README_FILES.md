# MV+FIBRE_TRENCH_PROGRESS_TRACKING

Place your files in this folder (Vite serves `public/` at the site root).

Expected files (you can adjust later in `src/modules/moduleConfigs.js`):
- `full.geojson`
- `mv_trench.geojson`
- `subs.geojson`
- `subs_text.geojson` (will be rendered as text via the shared `string_text` pipeline)
- `link` (optional: a text file containing a DWG/URL)
